=head1 NAME

Perl5::TestEachCommit - Test each commit in a pull request to Perl core

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Perl5::TestEachCommit;

    $self = Perl5::TestEachCommit->new();

    $self->prepare_repository();
    $self->display_plan();
    $self->get_commits();
    $self->display_commits();
    $self->examine_all_commits();
    $self->get_results();
    $self->display_results();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This library is intended for use by people working to maintain the
L<Perl core distribution|https://github.com/Perl/perl5>.

Commits to C<blead>, the main development branch in the Perl repository, are
most often done by pull requests.  Most such p.r.s consist of a single commit,
but commits of forty or eighty are not unknown.  A continuous integration
system (CI) ensures that each p.r. is configured, built and tested on
submission and on subsequent modifications.  That CI system, however, only
executes that cycle on the *final* commit in each p.r.  It cannot detect any
failure in a *non-final* commit.  This library provides a way to test each
commit in the p.r. to the same extent that the CI system tests the final
commit.

Why is this important?  Suppose that we have a pull request that consists of 5
commits.  In commit 3 the developer makes an error which causes F<make> to
fail.  The developer notices that and corrects the error in commit 4.  Commit
5 configures, builds and tests satisfactorily, so the CI system gives the p.r.
as a whole a PASS.  The committer uses that PASS as the basis for approving a
merge of the branch into C<blead>.

    Commit  Configure   Build       Test
    ------------------------------------
    1abcd       X         X           X
    2efab       X         X           X
    3cdef       X         0           -
    4dcba       X         X           X
    5fedc       X         X           X

If, for any reason (*e.g.,* bisection), some other developer in the future
needs to say F<git checkout 3cdef>, they will discover that at that commit the
build was actually broken.

=head2 Additional Functionality

As of version 0.06, this distribution now provides the functionality to
analyze breakage at the F<miniperl> level.  If it is known (or suspected) that
tests will break during F<make minitest_prep> or F<make minitest> then runtime
can be considerably reduced from the more typical case where breakage occurs
during F<make test_prep> or F<make test_harness>.  However, the two cases
cannot be mixed.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<new()>

=over 4

=item * Purpose

Perl5::TestEachCommit constructor.  Ensures that supplied arguments are
plausible, I<e.g.,> directories needed can be located.

=item * Arguments

    my $self = Perl5::TestEachCommit->new( { %opts } );

Single hash reference.  That hash B<must> include the following key-value
pairs:

=over 4

* C<workdir>

String holding path to a directory which is a F<git> checkout of the Perl core
distribution.  If you have previously set an environmental variable
C<SECONDARY_CHECKOUT_DIR> holding the path to such a directory, that will be
used; otherwise, path must be specified.

* C<start>

String holding SHA of the first commit in the series on which you wish
reporting.

* C<end>

String holding SHA of the last commit in the series on which you wish
reporting.

=back

In addition, that hash B<may> include the following key-value pairs:

=over 4

* C<branch>

F<git> branch which must exist and be available for C<git checkout> in the
directory specified by C<workdir>.  Defaults to C<blead>.

* C<configure_command>

String holding arguments to be passed to F<./Configure>.  Defaults to C<sh
./Configure -des -Dusedevel>.  Add < 1<Egt>/dev/null> to that string if you
don't need voluminous output to C<STDOUT>.

* C<make_test_prep_command>

String holding arguments to be passed to F<make test_prep>.  Defaults to
C<make test_prep>.  Add < 1<Egt>/dev/null> to that string if you don't need
voluminous output to C<STDOUT>.

* C<make_test_harness_command>

String holding arguments to be passed to F<make test_harness>.  Defaults to
C<make test_harness>.  Add < 1<Egt>/dev/null> to that string if you don't need
voluminous output to C<STDOUT>.

* C<skip_test_harness>

True/false value.  Defaults to false.  If true, when proceeding through a
series of commits in a branch or pull request, the C<make test_harness> stage
will be skipped on the assumption that any significant failures are going to
appear in the first two stages.

* C<make_minitest_prep_command>

String holding arguments to be passed to F<make minitest_prep>.  Defaults to
C<make minitest_prep>.  Add < 1<Egt>/dev/null> to that string if you don't
need voluminous output to C<STDOUT>. B<Note:> If this key-value pair is passed
to C<new()>, then any value passed to C<make_test_prep_command> or
C<make_test_harness_command> is ignored.

* C<make_minitest_command>

String holding arguments to be passed to F<make minitest>.  Defaults to C<make
minitest>.  Add < 1<Egt>/dev/null> to that string if you don't need voluminous
output to C<STDOUT>.  B<Note:> If this key-value pair is passed to C<new()>,
then any value passed to C<make_test_prep_command> or
C<make_test_harness_command> is ignored.

* C<verbose>

True/false value.  Defaults to false.  If true, prints to C<STDOUT> a summary of
switches in use and commits being tested.

=back

=item * Return Value

Perl5::TestEachCommit object (blessed hash reference).
