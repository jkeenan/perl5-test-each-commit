TODO list for Perl module Perl5::TestEachCommit

Improve Perl5::TestEachCommit::Util::usage().  As of now it's just a skeleton.
Write POD for it.

Write a program which will appear under scripts in the tarball and be
installable under /usr/local/bin which will call
Perl5::TestEachCommit::Util::process_command_line() to process switches, then
call a sensible collection of Perl5::TestEachCommit methods.

Write a subclass which during Configure, make test_prep and make test_harness
will divert all STDOUT to /dev/null.  Perl5::TestEachCommit::Quietly.
